# Interview Test


## Project Description

Write a function in React JS that fetches users data from the following API:
https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/users

Display a list of users where each element will display the user id, name and status. 

The list should show active users before inactive users. 

The active and inactive users should be sorted internally by user id.

For example:

User id name status
3 Peter Parker Active
5 Tony Stark  Active
1 Steve Rogers Inactive
2 Bruce Banner Inactive
